          <h2>What is a REST API?</h2>
          <p>
            REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web service architectural
            style that defines a set of constraints for creating and accessing web
            services. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are based on
            the REST architecture, and provide a way for two different computer
            systems to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs are
            designed to be simple, lightweight, and scalable, and typically use HTTP
            (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as their underlying communication protocol.
            They allow developers to access and manipulate resources on a remote
            system using a set of standardized HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT,
            PATCH and DELETE.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            REST APIs typically use a stateless client-server model, where the client
            makes requests to the server to perform operations on resources, such as
            retrieving data, creating new resources, updating existing resources, or
            deleting resources. Each request sent to the server contains all the
            necessary information for the server to fulfill the request, and the
            server responds with a status code and data in a format that the client
            understands - typically JSON. REST APIs are widely used in modern web
            development, and are a popular choice for building scalable, reliable, and
            interoperable web services. They are often used to build web applications,
            mobile apps, and other software that needs to interact with remote systems
            over the internet.

          <p>
            <br />
            Below is an example of the design of a REST API in a table format, with an
            additional column for description, which is not necessary once you
            understand the convention:
          </p>
          <br />
      
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>HTTP Method</th>
              <th>Endpoint</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>GET</td>
              <td>/cars</td>
              <td>Fetches all cars</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>GET</td>
              <td>/cars/<code>&ltid&gt</code></td>
              <td>Fetches a specific car by id</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>POST</td>
              <td>/cars</td>
              <td>Creates a new car</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>PUT</td>
              <td>/cars/<code>&ltid&gt</code></td>
              <td>
                Updates a specific car by id(intended to replace an entire ressource)
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>PATCH</td>
              <td>/cars/<code>&ltid&gt</code></td>
              <td>
                Updates a specific car by id(intended to replace parts of a ressource)
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>DELETE</td>
              <td>/cars/<code>&ltid&gt</code></td>
              <td>Deletes a specific car by id</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
      
          <h3>Get started</h3>
      
          <p>
            Let's create the actual implementation of the endpoints and make a CRUD
            API - for the time being we will just store the ressources (the cars) as
            objects in an array. We will code the endpoints in the `app.js` file which
            we made in the
            <a href="/express">Express tutorial</a> - so make sure that's working
            before you continue below.
          </p>
      
          <br />
      
          <p>
            Copy and paste the lines below into your `app.js` file - just below the
            instantiation of Express. The `app.use(express.json())` parses the JSON
            payload of incoming requests and converts it into a JavaScript object,
            which can then be used in our application. The rest of the code is our
            array of cars which we will use as database in the coming examples.
          </p>
      
          <div class="code-container">
            <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
              <pre>
                <code id="code-1">
      app.use(express.static("public"));
      
      const cars = [
        { id: 1, name: "Ford" },
        { id: 2, name: "Tesla" },
        { id: 3, name: "Ferrari" },
      ];      
      </code>
              </pre>
              <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>GET /cars</h3>
          <p>
            Now we are ready to make a route to handle GET requests to the `/cars`
            endpoint. The `data` property in the JSON object holds an array of car
            objects.
          </p>
          <div class="code-container">
            <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
              <pre>
                <code id="code-2">
      app.get("/cars", (req, res) => {
        res.send({data: cars});
      });
           
      </code>
              </pre>
              <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-2">copy</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you now run your app, go to your browser and navigate to
            <a href="http://localhost:8080/cars" target="_blank"
              >localhost:8080/cars</a
            >
            you should see the following:
          </p>
          <img src="./images/GetCars.png" alt="json object" />
      
          <h3>GET /cars/<code>&ltid&gt</code></h3>
          <p>
            Time to make a route to handle GET requests to a specific car based on id:
          </p>

          <div class="code-container">
            <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
              <pre>
                <code id="code-3">
      app.get("/cars/:id", (req, res) => {
        const foundCar = cars.find((car) => car.id === Number(req.params.id));
        res.send({ data: foundCar });
      });
           
      </code>
              </pre>
              <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-3">copy</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            In the code above we use the find() method. This method returns the first
            occurrence in our array that matches the search criteria, which in our
            case is that the id of the car has to be identical to the id coming from
            the `req.params.id`. Note that we have to parse the id coming from the
            `req.params.id`, since it is a string. If a car is found with the
            requested id, it is stored in the variable `foundCar` and send back as a
            response.
          </p>
      
          <br />
      
          <p>
            If you go to your browser and navigate to
            <a href="http://localhost:8080/cars/1" target="_blank"
              >localhost:8080/cars/1</a
            >
            you should see the following:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/GetSingleCar.png"
            alt="Json object"
          />
          <h3>POST /cars</h3>
          <p>
            Now let's make a route to handle a POST request. For this, we will have to
            use a tool called `Postman`, since browser can only make GET Requests.
          </p>
          <div class="code-container">
            <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
              <pre>
                <code id="code-4">
      let currentId = 3;
      app.post("/cars", (req, res) => {
        const carToCreate = req.body;
        carToCreate.id = ++currentId;
        cars.push(carToCreate);
        res.send({ data: carToCreate });
      });
           
      </code>
              </pre>
              <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-4">copy</button>
            </div>
          </div>
