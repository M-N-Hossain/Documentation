        Express, also known as Express.js, is a popular open-source web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple 
        and flexible interface for building web applications and APIs. Express.js is built on top of Node.js and provides a set 
        of features and tools to handle HTTP requests, routes, middleware, and other common web application functionalities.

    <p class="para">
        Express.js allows developers to quickly and easily create robust web applications and APIs by providing a minimal and flexible 
        set of features that can be easily extended and customized as needed. It also has a large ecosystem of plugins and middleware that 
        can be used to add additional functionality to an application.
    </p>


    <h3>Get started</h3>
    <p>1. Create a folder called `myapp` to contain the application</p>
    <p>2. Open the folder in VS Code</p>
    <p>3. Create a file called `app.js`</p>
    <p>4. Create a file called `package.json`</p>
    <p>5. Write a set of curly braces `{}` in the `package.json` file</p>

    <img
        class="expressImg"
      src="./images/Express1.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />
    <p>
      6. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and write the command `npm
      install express` to install Express
    </p>
    <p>
      7. You should now have a folder called `node_modules`, a
      `package-lock.json` file. Futhermore, the `package.json` file should now
      contain a JSON object called `dependencies` with one key/value pair as
      shown on the screenshot below:
    </p>
    <img
    class="expressImg"
      src="./images/Express2.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />
    <p>
      8. To allow us to use the import and export statements introduced in ES6
      (ECMAScript 6) modules we will have to add another key/value pair in the
      `package.json` to let Node.js know that we want to use it - write `"type":
      "module"` as shown below:
    </p>
    <img
    class="expressImg"
      src="./images/Express3.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />
    <p>
      9. Now let's import express in the `app.js` and instantiate it in a
      variable called `app`. To do so, copy the code below and paste it into
      `app.js`
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-1">
import express from "express";
const app = express();          
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      10. In the bottom of `app.js` we will now define a port and make the app
      listen on that port. When an Express app is listening on a specific port,
      it means that it is actively waiting for incoming HTTP requests on that
      port number, and any incoming requests that match the app's defined routes
      and methods will be handled by the app.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-2">
const PORT = 8080;
app.listen(PORT, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log("Server is running on", PORT);
  }
});         
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-2">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      11. It is now time to create our first route and with it let the app
      handle a HTTP GET request to the specific endpoint `/`. For now we will
      just let the app respond with a simple <code>&lth1&gt</code> tag:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-3">
app.get("/", (req, res) =>{
    res.send(`&lth1&gt Hello World &lth1&gt`);
});      
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-3">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      12. It is finally time to run the app! Open the integrated terminal in VS
      Code and write the command `node app.js`.
    </p>
    <p>13. Open your browser and navigate to the endpoint we created on <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/ </a></p>
    <p>14. You should be able to see the following in the browser:</p>
    <img
      class="expressImg"
      src="./images/Express4.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />

        Some of the key features of Express.js include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Routing:
            <p>
                Express.js provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes for handling HTTP requests.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Middleware:
            <p>
                Express.js middleware functions can be used to modify request and response objects, handle errors, and perform other tasks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Static file serving:
            <p>
                Express.js can serve static files, such as images and CSS files, directly from the file system.     
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">
        Overall, Express.js is a popular and widely used framework that can help developers build web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently.
