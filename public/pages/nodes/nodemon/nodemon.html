    Nodemon is a tool for Node.js development that helps to automatically restart the Node.js application when changes are made 
    to the source code. This can be very useful during the development process, as it eliminates the need to manually stop and 
    restart the application each time a change is made.
</p>
<p class="para">
    Nodemon works by watching the files in the application's directory and restarting the application whenever a change is detected. 
    This includes changes to JavaScript files, JSON files, and other files that the application may be using. Nodemon also monitors the 
    application's console output, and will restart the application if it crashes or throws an error.

      4. We can create a `nodemon.json` which controls which filestypes, if
      updated, will initialize a restart of the server. The image below shows
      what filetypes nodemon is looking for changes in:
